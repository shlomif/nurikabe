* Fix the problem with the expand_black_regions when all the black
squares are already connected.

Done:
-----

* Add a coords class instead of passing the coordinates as an array reference
of two elements.
    - Implement - to_s().
    - a from_s() constructor.

* Convert from Class::Accessor to Class::XSAccessor.
